|     For optimal performance we recommend to set                             |
|       NCORE = 2 up to number-of-cores-per-socket                            |
|     NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).      |
|     This setting can greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.       |
|     The default, NCORE=1 might be grossly inefficient on modern             |
|     multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines. Do your        |
|     own testing! More info at https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/NCORE      |
|     Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA                |
|     calculations (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested      |
|     yet).                                                                   |
|                                                                             |

|     You have a (more or less) 'large supercell' and for larger cells it     |
|     might be more efficient to use real-space projection operators.         |
|     Therefore, try LREAL= Auto in the INCAR file.                           |
|     Mind: For very accurate calculation, you might also keep the            |
|     reciprocal projection scheme (i.e. LREAL=.FALSE.).                      |
|                                                                             |

|     Possible solutions for this issue are:                                  |
|     - Please check whether the atoms are too close to each other.           |
|     - Decreasing POTIM might help during relaxations or MDs.                |
|     - Deleting CHGCAR or WAVECAR if incompatible with the structure.        |
|     - Try calculating without symmetrizing (ISYM = 0 or ISYM = -1).         |
|     - As last resort: using a different PAW for some of the atoms.          |
|                                                                             |
