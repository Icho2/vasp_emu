# VASP_EMU (LOGO TBD)

## Overview

## What we need to do:

1. [X] Add ML potential (Open Catalyst and pyAMFF)
2. [ ] Add NEB (WIP)
	-solid state NEB to optimize lattice constants
3. [ ] Add Dimer (WIP)
	-solid state Dimer to optimize lattice constants
4. [ ] Add MD and INCAR-associated settings (WIP)
5. [ ] Update OUTCAR (decide which output we want to emulate) (WIP)
6. [X] Make XDATCAR
7. [X] Make OSZICAR (basically a log file of stdout)
8. [X] Switch from ConfigParser to own implementation 
	* line string continuation not implemented but we've made ConfigParser our own
9. [X] Figure out optimizers
10. [ ] Testing/examples
11. [ ] Documentation
