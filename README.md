# VASPyML (Name and logo TBD)

## Overview

## What we need to do:

1. [ ] Add ML potential (Open Catalyst and pyAMFF)
2. [ ] Add NEB
	-solid state NEB to optimize lattice constants
3. [ ] Add Dimer
	-solid state Dimer to optimize lattice constants
4. [] Add MD and INCAR-associated settings
5. [] Update OUTCAR (decide which output we want to emulate)
6. [] Make XDATCAR
7. [] Make OSZICAR (basically a log file of stdout)
8. [] Switch from ConfigParser to own implementation that will only process ones we want
9. [] Figure out optimizers
10. [] Testing/examples
11. [] Documentation
